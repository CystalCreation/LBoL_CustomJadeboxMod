# Custom Jadebox Mod

This is a mod that adds several new Jadebox modifiers to the game. All of these modifiers provide both benefits and drawbacks to the player. Here is a list of all the Jadebox modifiers in the mod. These modifiers are all balanced to be beatable on lunatic with every character.
